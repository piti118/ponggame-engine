# Pong Game Engine for HW4

## Control
`e,d` move up and down for left player.

`i,k` moves up and down for the right player.

## For Homework

The two files you really need are PongGame.h and PongGame.cpp.
The rest are just to run it on computer terminal.

You will find useful information on how to integrate it with arduino in main.cpp.

## Compile to run on computer

You will need cmake and ncurses to compile this.

```
cmake .
make
./PongGame
```

If you are too lazy just head to [onlinegdb](https://onlinegdb.com/HJdjctiHM), 
the game is bit laggy there.
